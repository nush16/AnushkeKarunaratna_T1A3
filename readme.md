## **Project Description**

Creating a chemistry calculator for students or anyone interested in chemistry. This application will help determine characteristics  of a compound  and also identify compounds

Features include
- A calculator to determine molar weight, density and mols of the compound
- A PH calculator to calculate acidity of a solution and also calculate dilutions and molarity of a solution
- An 'identifier' to identify compounds and chemical formulas
- Data on elements from the periodic table

## **Installation**

Installing dependencies

```pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt```

Running Bash script

```bash ./src/run_main.sh```

## **Designing**

## **Functionality & Features**

### **Menu**
As soon as the program is running a menu of options is available to choose from. Type in the number to acess the submenu's


```
-------Menu-------
press 1 : Calculate molar weight, density or number of mols
press 2 : Acidity(pH), making a solution and dilutions
press 3 : Identify Chemicals and Chemical formulas
press 4 : Element data from the periodic table

--Other Options--
press 5 : Exit

Enter an option: 
```
### **Press 1 - Calculate molar weight, density or number of mols**
Pressing one from the main menu gives access to the submenu for calculating molar weight, density or number of mols. Type in the number to access the relevant option 

```
-------Calculate molar weight, density or number of mols-------
press 1 : Calculate molar weight
press 2 : Calculate density
press 3 : Calculate number of mols
press 4 : Exit

Enter an option: 
```
### **Press 1 -> Press 1 - Calculate molar weight**
Please see the below example 

```
To calculate the molar weight of a compound we need to know the element and how many of each element is in the compound

-> How many elements in the compound: 2

-> What is the first element (enter symbol): C
-> How many elements?: 2

-> What is the second element (enter symbol): O
-> How many elements?: 4

--> The molecular weight of this compound is 88.018 g/mol
```

### **Press 1 -> Press 2 - Calculate density**
Please see the below example 
```
To calculate the density of a compound we need to the mass(g) and volume(cm3) of the compound

-> What is the mass (g)?: 35
-> What is the volume (cm3)?: 67

--> The density of the compound is 0.52 g/cm3
```
### **Press 1 -> Press 3 - Calculate number of mols**
Please see the below example 
```
To calculate the number of mols of a compound we need to the mass(g) and molecular weight (g/mol) of the compound

-> What is the mass (g)?: 45
-> What is the molecular mass (g/mol)?: 87

--> The number of mols, when mass is 45.0 (g) and molecular weight is 87.0 (g/mol) is, 0.52 (mol)
```

### **Press 2 - Acidity(pH), making a solution and dilutions**
Pressing two from the main menu gives access to the submenu for calculating acidity, dilution and solution calculations. Type in the number to access the relevant option 
```
-------Acidity(pH), making a solution and dilutions-------
press 1 : Calculate acidity
press 2 : Making a solution
press 3 : Calculate diltuions
press 4 : Exit

Enter an option: 
```
### **Press 2 -> Press 1 - Calculate acidity**
Please see the below example 
```
To calculate the pH please insert the concentration (moles per litre)
-> What is the concentration (moles per litre)?: 8900

--> The pH is 3.9494

--> This is a base solution
```
### **Press 2 -> Press 2 - Making a solution**
Please see the below example



### **Press 2 -> Press 3 - Calculate dilutions**
Please see the below example
